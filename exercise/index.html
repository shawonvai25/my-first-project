    <p class="monk-mode">
      what is monk mode? monk mode is a period of immersion it's a period in
      which you say to yourself and you signal the people around you that listen
      I'm locked in I'm focused now from my understanding monk mode was floating
      around as a rough term from many years but when I started monk mode in
      early 2020 right before lockdown there was no real formula or way to do
      it.so I can only tell you my monk mode protocol maybe some other people
      have some other ideas but my monk mode protocol consists of no alcohol or
      weed, 30 minutes a day of exercising even if that's just a brisk walk in
      the park & 10 minutes a day of meditation . those three are your non
      negotiables.now there is a bunch of other protocols out there
